## What I've learned

> This semester I've learned many different things.
Firstly I learned abut the MEAN Stack. I learned the 
functions of Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node and how
API's are used to link the client and server to make 
a complete web application. I was able to put my knowledge
to the test in my own personal test project.

> Additionally, I learned more about the git workflow.
I now understand how to pull from the main working repository
onto my local repository and that I should always push my code
to separate branches related to my issue and never to the main
branch. I also know how to make pull requests that refernce
the issues that I solved with my commits.

> Working with venue has taught me how to work with a large 
codebase. I've learned the importance of code organization
and how to search for issues that may span across different files.

> Most importantly, I've learned how to fix issues in a clean
and efficient manner. Often times there are many different
possible solutions to a bug, but it is important to weigh the 
costs and effects of the different solutions and then to implement
the best solution with good coding style. Some of the bugs that
I took on required me to come up with creative solutions. For 
example, in order to add form validation for I created a regular
instructor courses expression that contains every legal course 
acronym and used the ng-pattern directive to compare the instructor's 
input to the regular expression.

## Moving Forward

> Moving forward I hope to continue working on 
this project next semester. Now that I am more familiar
with the code base and I am more comfortable with the
git workflow I should be able to hit the ground running.
I plan on taking care of a lot of bug fixes next semester
and help out with integrating any new features.
