## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Tested login form bug where autofill was not working correctly. 

> I tested the login form on Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer,
on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. The login form autofill feature seemed
to work fine on all these operating systems and browsers that I had
tested and also seemed to work on other people's laptops after a
refresh.

> While I don't know why the bug occured in the first place
it seems to be inconsistent and independent of the OS or browser.

## This Week's Plan

> Try to replicate Login form bug and see if I can add code to make sure it
doesn't happen again.

> Fix courseform bug that doesn't automatically assign instructors as supervisors
to the courses they create.
