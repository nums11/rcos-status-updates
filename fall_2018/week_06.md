## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Finished instructor course form validation by creating a regex string 
that contains all the valid department names (ECSE, CSCI, ARTS, etc.). Then 
I used angular's 'ng-pattern' directive to check if the inputted department
name is in the regex string. 

> I also used the 'ng-maxlength' directive to to make sure that the user does 
not input a department name of length greater than 4.  

## This Week's Plan

> Fix courseform bug that doesn't automatically assign instructors as supervisors
to the courses they create.
