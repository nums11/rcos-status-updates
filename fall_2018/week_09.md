## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Researched login form autofill bug. Found that the
autofill feature actually is dependent on the browser
you are using and is not a feature of the code. 

> I created a github issue for the bug and documented
the research I did so that anyone looking to tackle the
bug in the future can see the progress I made. I am 
leaving the bug for now since it is difficult to replicate
and isn't a major bug since it rarely occurs.

> I began looking at the courseform bug that doesn't 
automatically assign instructors as supervisors to the
courses they create.

## This Week's Plan

> Fix courseform bug that doesn't automatically assign 
instructors as supervisors to the courses they create.

> Take a look at any other small bugs that can be fixed.
