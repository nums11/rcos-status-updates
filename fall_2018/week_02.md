## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Configured gulp and mongo server.

> Fixed mongod bug and I learned that you have to run
the mongod command as "sudo mongod" because it requires 
root priveleges. 

> I also learned that you have to kill the mongod process
or else you will get an error that mongod is already running
the next time you try to open it. I learned that mongod processes
can be viewed using the 'ps ax | grep mongod' command.

## This Week's Plan

> Set up personal test project to learn the MEAN stack.
