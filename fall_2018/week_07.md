## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Added error message for instructors trying to add supervisors
that do not exist during course creation.

> Learned that you can use chrome developer tools to view source 
code and see the styling properties of html elements instead of 
manually trying to search for the styling.

> Learned more about the git workflow - push to branches instead
of just pushing to dev.

## This Week's Plan

> Fix courseform bug that doesn't automatically assign instructors as supervisors
to the courses they create.
