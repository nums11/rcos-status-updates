## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Finished Angular Test Project

> I ran into a bug a webpack bug where my app would 
not load because the tutorial I was following was 
using a different version of webpack than the version
my project was using. After tinkering with it I was 
able to fix it by updating my version of webpack.
